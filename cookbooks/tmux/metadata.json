Does a source install on RHEL family.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n- `node['tmux']['install_method']` - source or package, uses the appropriate recipe.\n- `node['tmux']['version']` - version of tmux to download and install from source.\n- `node['tmux']['checksum']` - sha256 checksum of the tmux tarball\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nUse the recipe for the installation method you want to use, or set the attribute on the node to install from that recipe and use the default recipe. The default recipe also manages `/etc/tmux.conf`.\n\nOn RHEL family, `node['tmux']['install_method']` is set to source by default. To install from package, the `yum::epel` recipe is required to get the tmux package, and the attribte would need to be set explicitly.\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright: 2009-2012, Opscode, Inc.
